# DAOC Sprint Manager - Product Context

## User Need

Dark Age of Camelot (DAOC) players need to maintain their sprint buff active during gameplay, which requires repeatedly pressing a key when the sprint icon disappears. This manual task:

1. Interrupts gameplay flow
2. Causes player fatigue during long sessions
3. Often leads to sprint dropping at critical moments
4. Creates an unnecessary distraction from game content

## Product Solution

The DAOC Sprint Manager automates sprint key management by:

1. Visually detecting the sprint icon in the game interface
2. Automatically pressing the sprint key when needed
3. Running unobtrusively in the system tray
4. Providing status feedback and controls when desired

## User Experience Goals

1. **Invisible when working**: The application should blend into the background during normal operation
2. **Simple to configure**: Minimal setup required to get running
3. **Reliable operation**: Consistent detection with minimal false positives/negatives
4. **Resource-efficient**: Negligible impact on game performance
5. **Adaptable**: Works with different UI configurations and game window sizes

## User Interaction Touchpoints

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Configuration of game window title
   - Selection of sprint icon Region of Interest (ROI)
   - Setting of sprint key binding
   - Template image selection/creation

2. **Ongoing Usage**:
   - System tray icon showing application status
   - Status tooltip with detection confidence and performance metrics
   - Context menu for Pause/Resume, Configuration, and Exit

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Logging for diagnostic information
   - Configuration adjustment tools
   - Test template creation utilities

## Feature Priorities

### Must Have (Phase 1-2)
- Window detection and ROI capture
- Template-based icon detection
- Keyboard input simulation
- Basic error handling and logging
- System tray UI with basic controls

### Should Have (Phase 3)
- Temporal consistency to reduce false detections
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Configuration GUI
- Detailed status display

### Could Have (Phase 3-4)
- Machine learning-based detection
- Multi-profile support
- Auto-startup with Windows
- Adaptive polling based on game state
- Advanced statistics and reporting

### Won't Have
- Complex game automation beyond sprint
- Anti-cheat circumvention features
- Integration with game client files
- Support for games other than DAOC

## User Personas

### Casual Player
- Plays a few hours per week
- Basic technical knowledge
- Wants "set and forget" functionality
- Prioritizes simplicity and reliability

### Hardcore Player
- Extended play sessions (4+ hours)
- More technical proficiency
- Wants detailed performance metrics
- Interested in customization options

### Realm vs. Realm (RvR) Player
- Needs critical timing in combat situations
- Requires very high reliability
- Concerned about application performance impact
- Needs sprint to activate consistently in fast-paced scenarios

## Success Metrics

From the user perspective, success is measured by:

1. **Reliability**: Percentage of sprint drops eliminated
2. **Performance**: No noticeable impact on game performance
3. **Ease of Use**: Time from installation to successful operation
4. **Stability**: Ability to run for extended periods without issues
5. **Adaptability**: Works across different character classes and UI layouts

## Product Roadmap

### Current State (Phase 2 Complete)
- Core functionality implemented
- Template-based detection with temporal consistency
- System tray UI with basic controls
- Helper utilities for configuration

### Next Iteration (Phase 3)
- Enhanced UI with configuration dialog
- ML-based detection option
- Multi-profile support
