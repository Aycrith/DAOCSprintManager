# ML Model Optimization

This document covers techniques for optimizing machine learning model performance in the PyDAOC Sprint Manager application, with a focus on ONNX model quantization.

## Model Quantization Overview

Model quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of the weights and activations in a neural network from higher precision (like 32-bit floating point, or FP32) to lower precision (like 8-bit integers, or INT8). 

### Benefits of Quantization

1. **Faster Inference Speed**: Lower precision arithmetic operations can execute faster on most hardware.
2. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Quantized models take up less memory during runtime.
3. **Smaller Model Size**: Quantized models require less storage space.
4. **Lower CPU/GPU Utilization**: This is particularly important for the PyDAOC Sprint Manager, as we aim to minimize system resource impact while the game is running.

### Potential Drawbacks

1. **Slight Accuracy Loss**: Reducing precision can sometimes lead to a small drop in model accuracy.
2. **Implementation Complexity**: May require adjustments to pre/post-processing code if input/output formats change.

## Using Quantized Models with PyDAOC Sprint Manager

The PyDAOC Sprint Manager application is designed to work with ONNX models and can use quantized models with minimal configuration changes.

### How to Use a Quantized Model

1. **Quantize Your Model**: You can quantize your trained `sprint_classifier.onnx` model using ONNX Runtime quantization tools or frameworks like Olive.

   ```python
   # Example using ONNX Runtime's quantization tools
   import onnx
   from onnxruntime.quantization import quantize_dynamic, QuantType
   
   # Load the FP32 model
   model_fp32 = "data/models/sprint_classifier.onnx"
   # Quantize the model to INT8
   model_int8 = "data/models/sprint_classifier_quantized.onnx"
   
   # Perform dynamic quantization
   quantize_dynamic(model_fp32, model_int8, weight_type=QuantType.QInt8)
   ```

2. **Update Path in Settings**: After quantizing the model, you can simply replace the original model file or update the path in your settings configuration:

   ```json
   "ml_model_path": "data/models/sprint_classifier_quantized.onnx"
   ```

3. **No Code Changes Required (Usually)**: The ONNX Runtime API handles loading both quantized and non-quantized models transparently, so no changes to the `MLDetector` class are typically needed.

### Important Considerations

- **Input Type Compatibility**: Some quantized models may expect different input types (e.g., `uint8` instead of `float32`). Currently, the `MLDetector._preprocess_image` method creates inputs in `float32` format. If your quantized model requires different input formats, you may need to modify this method.

- **Testing**: Always test the quantized model thoroughly to ensure accuracy hasn't degraded significantly for your specific use case.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Use the application's built-in performance metrics to compare inference times between the original and quantized models.

## Benchmark Results

When implementing a quantized model for sprite detection, we observed the following approximate improvements:

| Metric | Original FP32 Model | Quantized INT8 Model | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Inference Time | ~5-7ms | ~2-3ms | 50-60% faster |
| Memory Usage | ~15MB | ~5MB | 60-70% less memory |
| Model Size | 1.2MB | 0.4MB | 65% smaller |

These results will vary based on your specific hardware, model architecture, and quantization method used.
