# Progress Report

## Latest Updates
- Completed Task 4.4 (Model Trainer) setup and training data generation
- Successfully extracted and processed sprint icon from reference images
- Generated augmented training dataset with optimized parameters
- Created visualization tools for training data verification
- Established balanced dataset split (70/15/15 for train/val/test)

## Current Status
- Training data pipeline complete and verified
- Icon extraction and augmentation parameters optimized for sprint detection
- Ready for model training implementation

## Known Issues
- Limited training samples for inactive state - may need runtime augmentation
- Need to verify model performance with different buff bar backgrounds

## Next Steps
- Implement CNN model architecture
- Train initial model with generated dataset
- Implement model evaluation metrics
- Create inference pipeline for real-time detection
