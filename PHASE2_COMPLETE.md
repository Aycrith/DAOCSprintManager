# DAOC Sprint Manager - Phase 2 Complete

## Completed Implementation

Phase 2 of the DAOC Sprint Manager has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - `WindowManager`: Robust window detection and screen capture
   - `IconDetector`: Template matching with temporal consistency to reduce false detections
   - `InputManager`: Keyboard input simulation with safety features

2. **System Tray Application**
   - `SprintManagerApp`: Full system tray interface with status display
   - Menu options: Pause/Resume, Open Config, Exit
   - Thread management for clean application lifecycle

3. **Utilities and Configuration**
   - `ConfigManager`: Loading/saving settings with validation
   - `PerformanceMonitor`: Resource usage tracking
   - `Logger`: Comprehensive logging system

4. **Helper Tools**
   - `create_test_templates.py`: Creates test icon templates
   - `roi_helper.py`: Visual tool for configuring the Region of Interest

## Setup and Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure the Region of Interest:
   ```
   .\configure_roi.bat
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   .\start_sprint_manager.bat
   ```

## Current Features

- Automatic detection of sprint icon in the game window
- Presses the sprint key when icon is detected, releases when not detected
- Temporal consistency to reduce false detections
- Performance monitoring with FPS tracking
- System tray interface with status display
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Configurable settings

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. **Enhanced User Interface**
   - Add detailed statistics display
   - Create a configuration GUI
   - Add hotkey support for quick commands

2. **Advanced Detection Improvements**
   - Implement machine learning based detection as an option
   - Add support for dynamic icon recognition (handles UI changes)
   - Improve performance with optimized capture techniques

3. **Multi-Character Support**
   - Profile management for multiple characters
   - Quick switching between sprint key bindings

4. **Quality of Life Features**
   - Auto-startup with Windows
   - Minimize to tray on startup
   - Automatic game client detection
