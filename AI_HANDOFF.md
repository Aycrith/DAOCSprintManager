## Orchestrator Analysis & Next Steps

The v0.4.0 release with its core auto-update functionality is now fully tested, documented, and ready for GitHub release. All deliverables are complete and verified, with comprehensive end-to-end testing validating the robustness of the update system.

**Next Phase Focus:**
With v0.4.0 finalized, work can proceed on completing v0.5.0:
- Task 8.3.2: "Minimize to Tray instead of Closing" for GUI windows
- Task 8.4: Auto-Update Enhancements - Background Check & Notification
- Final testing and polish for v0.5.0 release

**Recommendation for Immediate Next Task:**
1. Proceed with GitHub release of v0.4.0 using the prepared package and documentation
2. Continue development of remaining v0.5.0 tasks
3. Focus on final testing and polish for v0.5.0 once implementation is complete

**Note on Version Management:**
- The auto-update feature (v0.4.0) has been fully tested and is ready for release
- The development branch may continue with v0.5.0 features, maintaining the current version number in the codebase
- When releasing v0.4.0, ensure that the specific release commit/tag is properly versioned

- **User Customization Options for UI (Task 8.3.1 Completed):**
  - Added "Start Minimized to Tray" option: Users can now configure the application to start directly in the system tray without displaying any window.
  - `start_minimized_to_tray` boolean field added to `AppSettings` model in `data_models.py`
  - Updated `config/settings.json.template` with the new setting (defaulting to `false`)
  - Added UI checkbox in `ConfigGUI`'s General tab
  - Modified `SystemTrayUI.start()` to respect this setting, hiding Tkinter root windows when enabled
  - End-to-end flow verified: config → AppSettings → UI → runtime behavior

- **UI Performance Statistics Display (Task 8.1 Completed including Tests):**
  - `PerformanceStatsWindow` implemented for real-time metrics display.
  - `SprintManagerApp` enhanced to track, provide, and reset performance data; launches stats window from tray.
  - **Unit tests in `tests/ui/test_performance_stats_window.py` are complete and passing (7 tests).**

- **Enhanced Logging and Diagnostics - Log Export (Task 8.2 Completed including Tests):**
  - `DiagnosticReportGenerator` implemented to collect logs, system info, and sanitized settings into a ZIP archive.
  - "Export Diagnostic Report" feature integrated into `SprintManagerApp` tray menu with progress display and save dialog.
  - **Unit tests in `tests/utils/test_diagnostic_report.py` are complete and passing (11 tests).**
  - `psutil` dependency noted for richer system info (added to requirements.txt).
