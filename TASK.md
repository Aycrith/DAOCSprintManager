# DAOC Sprint Manager - Task Tracking

## Phase 3 Tasks

(Assuming Phase 3 is largely complete and we are in a testing/refinement phase before a versioned release, similar to "Phase 4" in some plans, or "Step 6" in others. I'll reflect this as part of a major "Testing & Release" phase.)

  - [x] Create test data and scenarios - *Test data files and mock objects created.*
  - [x] Document test environment configuration - *Partially via `test_environment_setup.py` and test files.*

- [x] **Task 6.2: Feature Testing (Unit/Integration Tests for Python Modules)**
  - [x] Test Configuration GUI functionality (`tests/ui/test_config_gui.py`)
  - [x] Verify profile management features (partially in `test_tray_app.py`, `test_profile_io_manager.py`, etc.)
  - [x] Test detection methods (Template/ML - covered in `test_icon_detector.py`, `test_ml_detector.py`)
  - [x] Validate error handling and recovery (covered in individual module tests)
  - [x] Test core `WindowManager` (`tests/core/test_window_manager.py`)
  - [x] Test core `IconDetector` (`tests/core/test_icon_detector.py`)
  - [x] Test core `InputManager` (`tests/core/test_input_manager.py`)
  - [x] Test UI orchestrator `SprintManagerApp` (`tests/ui/test_tray_app.py`)
  - [x] **Higher-Level Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_detection_flow.py`)** - *Covers core detection workflow.*

- [x] **Bug Fix: System Tray UI Issues**
  - [x] Fix variable name issue in `SystemTrayUI._create_icon` method

  - [ ] Run extended stability tests
  - [ ] Generate performance test reports

- [ ] **Task 6.4: Documentation Finalization**
  - [ ] Update release notes for v0.3.0
  - [ ] Review and update user documentation (README, INSTALLATION, etc.)
  - [ ] Create quick-start guide
  - [ ] Document known issues and workarounds
  - [ ] Finalize test suite documentation

- [ ] **Task 6.5: Release Package Preparation**
  - [ ] Address critical test findings (if any from further testing)
  - [ ] Create final build (v0.3.0)
  - [ ] Generate package checksums
  - [ ] Prepare release announcement
