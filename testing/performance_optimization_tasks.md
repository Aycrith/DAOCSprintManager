## Optimization Guidelines

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical**: Severely impacts core functionality
2. **High**: Noticeably affects user experience
3. **Medium**: Optimization would provide clear benefits
4. **Low**: Minor improvements possible

### Implementation Approach
1. Measure current performance (baseline)
2. Identify bottlenecks through profiling
3. Implement targeted optimizations
4. Measure impact
5. Document improvements

## Notes
- Focus on optimizations that provide the most significant impact
- Consider trade-offs between performance and maintainability
- Document any dependencies or side effects of optimizations
- Maintain test coverage when implementing optimizations
