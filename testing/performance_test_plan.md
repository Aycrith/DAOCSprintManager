# DAOC Sprint Manager - Performance Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the DAOC Sprint Manager v0.3.0. The goal is to establish performance baselines, identify potential bottlenecks, and ensure the application maintains stable performance over extended periods.

## 1. Test Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Establish baseline performance metrics for typical usage scenarios
- Verify application stability over extended runtime periods
- Identify potential memory leaks or resource usage growth
- Measure and optimize detection cycle performance
- Compare performance impact of different detection methods

### Success Criteria
- CPU Usage: < 10% average on modern systems (4+ cores)
- Memory Usage: < 200MB stable (no continuous growth)
- Detection Cycle Time: < 50ms per frame
- No resource leaks over 4+ hours of operation
- Stable FPS matching configuration (e.g., 30 FPS if set to 30)

## 2. Test Scenarios

### 2.1 Baseline Performance Test
**Purpose:** Establish normal operating performance metrics
**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Configuration:**
- Single game window (mocked)
- Default settings (template matching)
- Standard detection cycle (30 FPS)
**Success Criteria:**
- Stable CPU/Memory usage
- Consistent frame timing
- No error accumulation

### 2.2 Long-Duration Stability Test
**Purpose:** Identify memory leaks and performance degradation
**Duration:** 4 hours minimum
**Configuration:**
- Standard settings
- Continuous operation
- Regular profile checks
**Success Criteria:**
- No memory growth trend
- Stable CPU usage
- No performance degradation
- Error counts within acceptable limits

### 2.3 High FPS Stress Test
**Purpose:** Verify performance under maximum load
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Configuration:**
- Maximum supported FPS (60)
- Aggressive detection settings
- Rapid window checks
**Success Criteria:**
- Maintained FPS target
- CPU usage < 20%
- Memory usage stable
- No error accumulation

### 2.4 Detection Method Comparison
**Purpose:** Compare template vs ML detection performance
**Duration:** 30 minutes per method
**Configuration:**
- Alternate between template and ML methods
- Standard FPS (30)
- Same test image set
**Success Criteria:**
- Comparative metrics for both methods
- Performance impact quantification
- Resource usage differences

## 5. Test Procedures

### 5.1 General Test Setup
1. Clean system state (restart if needed)
2. Close unnecessary applications
3. Record baseline system metrics
4. Launch application with specified configuration
5. Start performance_monitor.py
6. Execute test scenario
7. Collect and save metrics
8. Generate test report

### 5.2 Scenario-Specific Procedures

#### Baseline Test Procedure
```python
# Example monitoring script structure
def run_baseline_test():
    # 1. Configure application
    app_config = {
        'detection_method': 'template',
        'capture_fps': 30,
        'window_title': 'MOCK_GAME'
    }
    
    # 2. Launch application
    app_process = launch_app(app_config)
    
    # 3. Start monitoring
    monitor = PerformanceMonitor(app_process.pid)
    monitor.start()
    
    # 4. Run for 30 minutes
    time.sleep(1800)
    
    # 5. Collect results
    results = monitor.get_results()
    monitor.stop()
    
    # 6. Generate report
    generate_report(results, 'baseline_test')
```

#### Long-Duration Test Procedure
```python
def run_long_duration_test():
    # Similar structure to baseline
    # but with 4-hour duration and
    # periodic checks for memory growth
    pass
```
