- ✅ Verified build contents and distribution archive
- 📝 Next steps: Final testing of distribution package and release preparation

## Current Development Focus: Comprehensive Testing & Release Preparation (v0.3.0)

### System Tray UI Fixes - Completed

- **Fixed System Tray Icon Creation Issue:**
  - Resolved a bug in the `_create_icon` method of the `SystemTrayUI` class.
  - Fixed incorrect variable reference where `size` was used instead of `width` and `height`.
  - Ensured proper icon sizing from the application settings.
  - Improved code quality with better docstrings and type hints.
  - Verified functionality by running the application in test mode.

### Performance Testing (Task 6.3) - In Progress

- **Performance Test Plan Created:**
  - Comprehensive test plan documented in `testing/performance_test_plan.md`.
  - Defined clear objectives, success criteria, and test scenarios.
  - Established metrics collection strategy using `performance_monitor.py`.
  - Created structured approach for baseline, long-duration, and stress testing.

- **Performance Test Implementation Started:**
  - Created `testing/performance_test_runner.py` for automated test execution.
  - Implemented support for three primary test scenarios:
    - Baseline Performance Test (30 minutes)
    - Long-Duration Stability Test (4 hours)
    - High FPS Stress Test (1 hour)
  - Added robust logging, metrics collection, and results storage.
  - Integrated with existing `performance_monitor.py`.

**Next Steps in Performance Testing:**
1. Execute baseline performance tests.
2. Collect and analyze initial metrics.
3. Implement additional test scenarios if needed.
4. Document performance baselines.

### Integration Testing (Task 6.2) - Completed

- **Detection Workflow Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_detection_flow.py`):**
  - A comprehensive integration test suite has been created and verified.
  - These tests validate the end-to-end detection workflow, from simulated window capture through icon detection to mock input actions.
  - Key aspects covered: component interactions, data flow, temporal consistency in an integrated environment, and error handling.
  - The suite uses a `MockWindowManager` to provide test images and a `MockInputManager` to verify actions, allowing the core `IconDetector` and `SprintManagerApp` logic to interact with minimal internal mocking.

### Module Unit/Integration Testing (Task 6.2) - Completed

- **Core Logic Modules Fully Tested (>90% coverage for these components):**
  - `IconDetector`, `InputManager`, `WindowManager`.
- **Key UI Components Tested:**
  - `ConfigGUI`, `SprintManagerApp` (TrayApp).
- **Testing Infrastructure:**
  - Performance Monitor (`testing/performance_monitor.py`) functional and tested.
  - Test runner (`run_tests.py`) correctly configured for `pytest` and `pytest-cov`, targeting `src` for coverage.

**Overall Status:** With Task 6.2 completed and Task 6.3 now in progress, the focus is on establishing performance baselines and ensuring the application meets its performance requirements. The comprehensive test plan and automated test runner provide a solid foundation for this phase.

**Next Steps in Testing & Release Prep:**

1. Proceed with Task 6.3: Performance Testing.
2. Finalize all documentation (Task 6.4).
3. Prepare the release package (Task 6.5).
