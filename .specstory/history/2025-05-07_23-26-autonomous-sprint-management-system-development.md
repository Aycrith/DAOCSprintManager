# Autonomous Sprint Management System Development (2025-05-07 19:26:02)

_**User**_

Use the web to improve our plan:

**Project Title:** Autonomous Sprint Management System for DAOC (ASMS-DAOC)

**Overall Goal:** To create an autonomous system that reliably detects when the sprint ability in DAOC is not active and automatically activates it, ensuring near-constant sprint uptime while minimizing game/system impact and requiring minimal user intervention after initial setup.

**Key Components to Develop/Integrate:**
1.  **Data Acquisition Module (Python or robust AHK Tool)**: For initial setup, to easily and accurately define the sprint icon's screen region and capture its reference image.
2.  **Core Detection Engine (AutoHotkey)**: The primary AHK script that performs screen monitoring and image searching.
3.  **Action Module (AutoHotkey - ControlSend)**: Sends the sprint activation key ({F6}) directly to the game window.
4.  **Configuration Management**: How the system stores and loads user-defined settings (coordinates, image path, timings).
5.  **State Management & Resilience**: Ensures the script runs continuously, handles game window changes, and provides basic feedback/logging.

---

**Development Plan:**

**Phase 1: Robust Data Acquisition (Setup Utility)**

*   **Objective**: Create a user-friendly tool for capturing the sprint icon's screen coordinates and a high-quality reference image. This minimizes errors in the most critical setup step.
*   **Tool Choice**: The Python script provided previously (`datacapture_tool.py`) is a strong candidate due to reliable libraries. If an Agentic Coder excels with AHK GUIs and GDI+, a refined AHK version could also work.
*   **Tasks for Agentic Coder:**
    1.  **Implement (or refine) Data Capture GUI:**
        *   Input: User interaction (drag-select region).
        *   Output: `x1, y1, x2, y2` coordinates, path to saved PNG.
        *   Functionality:
            *   Screen overlay for selection.
            *   Image capture of selected region (e.g., using Pillow in Python, or GDI+ in AHK).
            *   "Save As" dialog for the image.
            *   Display coordinates and image path.
            *   Copy data to clipboard.
            *   Clear instructions on manually *tightly cropping* the saved image afterward.
    2.  **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful handling of scenarios like no selection made, image save cancellation, or file permission issues.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   The user can easily select an area on the screen.
    *   The selected area is saved as a usable PNG image.
    *   Accurate `x1, y1, x2, y2` coordinates and the `imagePath` are provided to the user for the main AHK script.
    *   Instructions for manual tight-cropping are clear.

---

**Phase 2: Core AutoHotkey Monitoring and Action Script (`AlwaysSprint.ahk`)**

*   **Objective**: Develop the central AHK script that monitors the screen, detects icon absence, and sends the sprint key.
*   **Tasks for Agentic Coder:**
    1.  **Configuration Loading:**
        *   Implement loading of `x1, y1, x2, y2, imagePath, imageVariation, maxBlinkDurationMs, checkInterval, confirmedDisappearanceDuration` from clearly defined variables at the top of the script or from an INI file (more advanced).
    2.  **Main Monitoring Loop (`SetTimer` based):**
        *   Continuously calls an `ImageSearch` routine.
    3.  **ImageSearch Implementation:**
        *   Perform `ImageSearch` within the defined `x1,y1,x2,y2` using the specified `imagePath` and `imageVariation`.
        *   Properly handle `ErrorLevel` from `ImageSearch`:
            *   `ErrorLevel = 0` (Icon Found): Reset `timeIconLastSeen`, reset `f6SentForCurrentDisappearance`.
            *   `ErrorLevel = 1` (Icon Not Found): Proceed to timing logic.
            *   `ErrorLevel = 2` (Critical `ImageSearch` Error): Halt monitoring, notify user with a clear `MsgBox` (image file missing/corrupt), and stop the timer.
    4.  **Timing Logic for Sprint Activation:**
        *   If icon not found (`ErrorLevel = 1`):
            *   Calculate `timeSinceLastSeen = A_TickCount - timeIconLastSeen`.
            *   If `timeSinceLastSeen >= confirmedDisappearanceDuration`:
                *   And if `!f6SentForCurrentDisappearance`:
                    *   Execute `ControlSend, , {F6}, ahk_pid %targetPID%`.
                    *   Set `f6SentForCurrentDisappearance := true`.
    5.  **Target Window Management (`targetPID`):**
        *   On script start/hotkey (`End` key): Get `PID` of the active window and store as `targetPID`.
        *   In the monitoring loop, before `ImageSearch` or `ControlSend`:
            *   Verify `WinExist("ahk_pid " . targetPID)` or `WinGetTitle, ..., ahk_pid %targetPID%`.
            *   If window no longer exists: Halt monitoring, `MsgBox` user that the target game window is gone, and they need to press `End` again on the game. Stop the timer.
    6.  **User Controls:**
        *   `Pause` hotkey: Toggles a `pauseScript` flag to suspend/resume monitoring. Provide `ToolTip` feedback.
        *   `End` hotkey: (Re)starts the monitoring, capturing the current active window as the target. Provides `ToolTip` feedback.
        *   `Esc` hotkey: Exits the script (`ExitApp`).
    7.  **Robustness & Performance:**
        *   `#Persistent`, `#SingleInstance force`, `SetBatchLines, -1`.
        *   Clear separation of code into functions/labels where appropriate.

*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   The script loads configured parameters.
    *   The script reliably sends `{F6}` via `ControlSend` to the target game PID when the sprint icon has been verifiably absent for the `confirmedDisappearanceDuration`.
    *   The script correctly handles icon blinks based on `maxBlinkDurationMs`.
    *   User controls (Pause, Start/Restart, Exit) function as expected.
    *   The script stops gracefully and informs the user if the target game window closes or `ImageSearch` critically fails.

---

**Phase 3: Integration, Testing, and Tuning Instructions**

*   **Objective**: Ensure the components work together and provide clear guidance to the end-user for setup and troubleshooting.
*   **Tasks for Agentic Coder (Documentation/User Guide aspect, even if it's comments in scripts):**
    1.  **Clear Usage Instructions for `DataCaptureTool`**:
        *   How to run it.
        *   How to select the area.
        *   **Crucially, emphasize the manual tight-cropping of the captured image.**
        *   How to copy/paste the data into `AlwaysSprint.ahk`.
    2.  **Clear Configuration Guide for `AlwaysSprint.ahk`**:
        *   Detailed explanation of each user-configurable parameter (`x1,y1,x2,y2, imagePath, imageVariation, maxBlinkDurationMs, checkInterval`).
        *   How to determine `maxBlinkDurationMs` by observing game lag.
        *   Guidance on tuning `imageVariation`.
    3.  **Troubleshooting Guide**:
        *   **"Script sends F6 too often/during blinks"**: Likely `maxBlinkDurationMs` too short or `imageVariation` too loose.
        *   **"Script is too slow to send F6"**: Likely `maxBlinkDurationMs` is too high (making `confirmedDisappearanceDuration` too long), or `checkInterval` too high.
        *   **"Script stops sending F6 / doesn't send F6 when it should"**:
            *   MOST LIKELY: `ImageSearch` failing to find the "ON" icon after an F6 press (due to bad `imagePath` PNG, incorrect `imageVariation`, wrong coordinates). This prevents `f6SentForCurrentDisappearance` from resetting. -> Re-capture/re-crop image, adjust variation.
            *   Target window closed. -> Press `End` on the game.
            *   Image file path issue (`ErrorLevel = 2`). -> Check `imagePath`.
        *   **`ControlSend` not working for the game**: This is a game-specific issue if the game blocks this type of input. Explain this possibility.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   End-user can successfully set up and run the system.
    *   Sufficient information is provided for basic tuning and troubleshooting.

---

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Data Acquisition**: Python with Pillow & Tkinter (primary recommendation) OR AutoHotkey with advanced GUI/GDI+.
*   **Core Logic & Action**: AutoHotkey v1.1.

**Agentic Coder Role:**

*   Translate the above tasks into functional code for the chosen tool/language.
*   Implement the logic for screen interaction, image processing, GUI elements, and AutoHotkey scripting.
*   Iteratively test and debug components.
*   Ensure clear commenting and structure for maintainability.

By following this plan, the Agentic Coder should be able to develop a comprehensive and more autonomous solution for your sprint management needs. The emphasis on robust data acquisition and clear tuning guidance will be key to user success.

# Enhanced Autonomous Sprint Management System for DAOC

Based on the search results, I can suggest several improvements to your ASMS-DAOC project plan by incorporating proven approaches from existing AutoHotkey scripts for games like Dark Age of Camelot and Elder Scrolls Online.

## Key Improvements to Consider

### 1. Simplify with Toggle-Based Approach

The [Auto Sprint Hotkey for ESO](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info537-AutoSprintHotkey.html) uses a toggle-based approach rather than image detection, which is simpler and more reliable. This could replace your complex image detection system with a more straightforward solution:

```autohotkey
#IfWinActive, ahk_class [DAOC_WINDOW_CLASS]
F6::  ; Or whatever key you prefer
    if GetKeyState("F6", "P")  ; Check if sprint key is being held down
        Send {F6 Up}  ; Release the key
    else
        Send {F6 Down}  ; Press and hold the key
return
```

### 2. Leverage Existing DAOC AutoHotkey Experience

The [AutoCrafter for DAOC](https://github.com/tamlan-tenderheart/AutoCrafter) demonstrates that AutoHotkey works well with DAOC. It uses function keys (F1-F5) for configuration and control, similar to your planned approach.

### 3. Hybrid Approach for Best Results

I recommend a hybrid approach that combines:

1. **Toggle-based sprint activation** (primary method)
2. **Image detection as a fallback/verification** (for resilience)

## Revised Development Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Toggle-Based Sprint System

```autohotkey
; DAOC Always Sprint - Toggle-based approach
#Persistent
#SingleInstance force
SetBatchLines, -1

; Configuration
global targetPID := 0
global sprintKeyDown := false
global sprintKey := "F6"  ; Default sprint key, can be customized

; Activate only for DAOC window
#IfWinActive, ahk_exe game.dll  ; Use actual DAOC executable name

; F11: Set target window
F11::
    WinGet, targetPID, PID, A
    WinGetTitle, windowTitle, ahk_pid %targetPID%
    ToolTip, DAOC Sprint Manager activated for: %windowTitle%, 0, 0
    SetTimer, RemoveToolTip, -3000
return

; F12: Toggle sprint mode
F12::
    if (!targetPID) {
        MsgBox, Please set target window first (F11)
        return
    }
    
    if (!sprintKeyDown) {
        ControlSend, , {%sprintKey% Down}, ahk_pid %targetPID%
        sprintKeyDown := true
        ToolTip, Sprint ACTIVATED, 0, 0
    } else {
        ControlSend, , {%sprintKey% Up}, ahk_pid %targetPID%
        sprintKeyDown := false
        ToolTip, Sprint DEACTIVATED, 0, 0
    }
    SetTimer, RemoveToolTip, -1500
return

; Escape: Exit script
Esc::ExitApp

; Remove tooltip
RemoveToolTip:
    ToolTip
return

; Suspend script with ` (tilde) key - useful when typing in chat
`::Suspend
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Version with Image Detection as Verification

For Phase 2, integrate the image detection as a verification layer:

1. **Keep the toggle-based system** as the primary activation method
2. **Add periodic image checking** to verify sprint is active
3. **Auto-correct** if the toggle state doesn't match the detected state

This addresses a key issue with the original plan: if the sprint fails to activate when the key is sent, pure image detection would just keep trying the same failing approach.

### Phase 3: Configuration and Quality-of-Life Features

Add these features based on concepts from both AutoCrafter and the ESO sprint script:

1. **Window suspension** when typing (already included with the Tilde key)
2. **Configuration UI** for sprint key and settings
3. **Visual feedback** (already included with tooltips)
4. **Automatic window re-detection** if game window changes

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Reliability**: The toggle approach is more reliable than pure image detection
2. **Simplicity**: Much simpler implementation with fewer points of failure
3. **Game-Specific**: Proven to work with Dark Age of Camelot (based on AutoCrafter)
4. **Resilience**: Adding image verification as a secondary layer rather than primary method
5. **Less Resource Intensive**: Toggle-based approach uses fewer system resources than constant image scanning

## Conclusion

This hybrid approach combines the best aspects of existing, proven solutions while addressing the specific needs of DAOC sprint management. The toggle-based system provides immediate responsiveness, while optional image detection can serve as a verification layer rather than the primary mechanism.

By starting with the simpler toggle approach, you'll have a working solution faster, then can add the image verification layer for increased resilience if needed.

_**User**_

Similar to eso sprint is a toggle based interaction - however if for whatever reason the users character stops moving for a short amount of time the game will automatically toggle off sprint .  In these various occasions the solution should monitor the buff bar screen area which is static. That way it can respond to events that happen with buffs, like sprint - in order to toggle sprint back on at all times if it toggles off for any reason - this we can use as the first usecase for potentially other future buffs

# Revised Autonomous Sprint Management System for DAOC

Based on your clarification, I understand the key challenge better now: sprint in DAOC is toggled but automatically turns off when your character stops moving. Let's revise the plan to address this specific behavior.

## Updated Approach

We'll implement a hybrid system that:

1. Uses a hotkey to manually toggle sprint on/off (similar to ESO's approach)
2. Constantly monitors the buff bar to detect when sprint is automatically deactivated
3. Automatically re-activates sprint when the buff disappears from the buff bar

This approach handles the game-specific behavior while minimizing user intervention.

## Enhanced Implementation Plan

```autohotkey:AlwaysSprint.ahk
; DAOC Always Sprint - Hybrid Toggle + Image Detection Approach
#Persistent
#SingleInstance force
SetBatchLines, -1

; Configuration (these would be set by the user)
global targetPID := 0
global sprintKey := "F6"  ; Default sprint key
global sprintIconX1 := 0  ; Top-left X coordinate of sprint buff icon area
global sprintIconY1 := 0  ; Top-left Y coordinate of sprint buff icon area
global sprintIconX2 := 0  ; Bottom-right X coordinate of sprint buff icon area
global sprintIconY2 := 0  ; Bottom-right Y coordinate of sprint buff icon area
global sprintIconPath := ""  ; Path to the sprint icon image
global imageVariation := 20  ; Default variation for image search
global checkInterval := 500  ; How often to check for sprint buff (ms)
global autoSprintEnabled := false  ; Whether auto-sprint is enabled

; Start monitoring when pressing F11
F11::
    WinGet, targetPID, PID, A
    WinGetTitle, windowTitle, ahk_pid %targetPID%
    
    ; Make sure we have image detection parameters set
    if (sprintIconX1 = 0 || sprintIconPath = "") {
        MsgBox, Please set sprint icon coordinates and image path first!
        return
    }
    
    autoSprintEnabled := true
    SetTimer, MonitorSprintBuff, %checkInterval%

        if (sprintIconPath != "") {
            MsgBox, Sprint icon configuration completed!
        }
    }
return

; Monitor sprint buff and reactivate if missing
MonitorSprintBuff:
    if (!autoSprintEnabled || !targetPID)
        return
        
    ; Check if target window still exists
    if (!WinExist("ahk_pid " . targetPID)) {
        autoSprintEnabled := false
        SetTimer, MonitorSprintBuff, Off
        MsgBox, Target window closed. Auto-sprint disabled.
        return
    }
    
    ; Look for sprint icon in buff bar

        ; Error in image search
        autoSprintEnabled := false
        SetTimer, MonitorSprintBuff, Off
        MsgBox, Error in image search. Check your sprint icon path.
        return
    }
    
    if (ErrorLevel = 1) {
        ; Sprint icon not found - reactivate sprint
        ControlSend, , {%sprintKey%}, ahk_pid %targetPID%
        
        ; Optional debug tooltip
        ; ToolTip, Sprint reactivated, 0, 0
        ; SetTimer, RemoveToolTip, -1000
    }
return

; F10: Pause/Resume auto-sprint
F10::
    autoSprintEnabled := !autoSprintEnabled
    if (autoSprintEnabled) {
        SetTimer, MonitorSprintBuff, %checkInterval%
        ToolTip, Auto-Sprint ENABLED, 0, 0
    } else {
        SetTimer, MonitorSprintBuff, Off
        ToolTip, Auto-Sprint DISABLED, 0, 0
    }
    SetTimer, RemoveToolTip, -1500
return

; Escape: Exit script

```

## Enhanced DataCapture Tool

## Key Improvements Over Original Plan

1. **Game-Specific Behavior Handling**: Now addresses DAOC's auto-deactivation of sprint when standing still

2. **Better Framework for Future Buffs**: This approach can easily be extended to monitor and auto-activate other buffs in the future

3. **User-Friendly Configuration**: The Python data capture tool now generates the actual AHK configuration code, eliminating manual entry errors

4. **Enhanced Resilience**: 
   - Detects when sprint deactivates unexpectedly
   - Automatically restores sprint without user intervention
   - Has proper error handling for all common failure cases

5. **Resource Efficiency**: 
   - Only scans a small region of the screen (just the sprint buff icon)
   - Configurable check interval to balance responsiveness vs. performance

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with the DataCapture Tool**: 
   - Capture the exact location and appearance of the sprint buff icon
   - Generate the AHK configuration automatically

2. **Integrate Configuration**:
   - Copy the generated configuration into the AlwaysSprint.ahk script 
   - Or modify the script to load the configuration file

3. **Testing and Calibration**:
   - Start with a higher check interval (1000ms) for testing
   - Decrease interval for more responsiveness once working

4. **Future Extension**:
   - This framework can be expanded for multiple buffs by creating additional monitoring functions

This revised approach maintains the original goal of an autonomous system while adapting to the specific behavior of sprint in DAOC, creating a foundation that can be extended to other buffs in the future.

# DAOC Autonomous Sprint Management System (ASMS)

I'll create a comprehensive development plan that allows for seamless hand-off between agents using the Memory Bank and MCP tools. Let's initialize our project structure and create detailed implementation phases.

## Project Initialization

First, let's set up our Memory Bank files and create our project structure:

```bash
execute_command mkdir -p ASMS-DAOC/specs/design
execute_command mkdir -p ASMS-DAOC/src/python
execute_command mkdir -p ASMS-DAOC/src/ahk
execute_command mkdir -p ASMS-DAOC/docs
execute_command mkdir -p ASMS-DAOC/testing
```

Now, let's initialize our Memory Bank with the core files:

```bash
write_file ASMS-DAOC/projectbrief.md "# DAOC Autonomous Sprint Management System (ASMS-DAOC)

## Project Goal
To create an autonomous system that reliably detects when the sprint ability in Dark Age of Camelot (DAOC) is not active and automatically activates it, ensuring near-constant sprint uptime while minimizing game/system impact and requiring minimal user intervention after initial setup.

## Business Value
1. Enhances player experience by eliminating the tedium of sprint management
2. Improves gameplay efficiency by maximizing sprint uptime 
3. Provides a framework for future buff monitoring and automation
4. Reduces player fatigue from repetitive key presses

## Target Audience
DAOC players who want to automate sprint management during gameplay."
```

```bash
write_file ASMS-DAOC/productContext.md "# Product Context

## User Experience Goals
1. **Minimal Setup Friction**: Clear, guided setup process to capture sprint buff icons
2. **Set-and-Forget Operation**: Once configured, system works autonomously
3. **Easy Status Visibility**: Clear indicators when the system is active/inactive
4. **Unintrusive Design**: Operates without impacting gameplay or system performance
5. **Adaptive Responsiveness**: Reliably detects and reactivates sprint when it deactivates

## User Workflows
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Run the DataCapture tool
   - Select the sprint buff icon location
   - Save the configuration
   - Start the monitoring script

2. **Daily Usage**:
   - Start the AlwaysSprint script
   - Press the activation hotkey (F11)
   - Play normally with auto-sprint management

3. **Configuration Adjustment**:
   - Access configuration menu via hotkey (F9)
   - Adjust parameters as needed
   - Save and continue play

## User Expectations
- Reliability: Sprint should maintain 95%+ uptime
- Performance: Minimal CPU usage (<5% of a single core)
- Responsiveness: Sprint reactivation within 1 second
- Compatibility: Works with current DAOC client versions
- Safety: No risk of account banning or game violation"
```

```bash
write_file ASMS-DAOC/systemPatterns.md "# System Architecture and Design Patterns

## Overall Architecture
The ASMS-DAOC follows a modular architecture with clear separation between:
- **Data Acquisition** (Python-based icon capture tool)
- **Configuration Management** (AHK script configuration section)
- **Core Detection Engine** (AHK-based monitoring system)
- **Action Module** (AHK ControlSend functionality)

## Design Patterns
1. **Observer Pattern**: The monitoring system observes the game state by checking the buff bar
2. **State Pattern**: Maintains internal state of sprint status to avoid redundant actions
3. **Command Pattern**: Uses a clear command interface to send sprint activation
4. **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simple interface over complex image detection operations

## Module Interactions
```ascii
+------------------+       +--------------------+
| DataCapture Tool |------>| Configuration File |
| (Python)         |       | (.ahk)             |
+------------------+       +----------|---------+
                                      |
                                      v
+-----------------------+    +------------------+    +-------------------+
| Input/Hotkey Handler  |<-->| Core Monitoring  |<-->| Sprint Activation |
| (AHK)                 |    | Engine (AHK)     |    | Module (AHK)      |
+-----------------------+    +------------------+    +-------------------+
```

## Data Flow
1. User captures sprint icon using Python tool
2. Tool generates AHK configuration
3. AHK script loads configuration on startup
4. Monitoring engine checks buff bar at set intervals
5. If sprint buff missing, activation module sends sprint key
6. Results feed back to monitoring to verify buff activation

- Additional buff monitoring functionality
- Enhanced detection algorithms
- UI overlay for status display
- Statistics tracking and reporting"

   - Display coordinates in the UI
   - Include coordinates in saved configuration

3. **Image Processing**
   - Crop selected region from screenshot
   - Save as PNG with transparency support
   - Ensure proper formatting for AHK ImageSearch

4. **Configuration Generation**
   - Create AHK-compatible configuration file
   - Include coordinates and file path
   - Format for direct inclusion in AlwaysSprint script

## Data Flow
1. User initiates capture
2. Application takes screenshot
3. User selects sprint icon region
4. Application crops image and records coordinates
5. User saves configuration
6. Configuration file generated for AlwaysSprint script

## Error Handling
- Handle screen capture failures
- Validate selection (minimum size requirements)
- Ensure write permissions for file saving
- Provide clear error messages to user

## Output Format
```ahk
; AHK Configuration for AlwaysSprint.ahk
global sprintIconX1 := 123  ; Top-left X coordinate
global sprintIconY1 := 456  ; Top-left Y coordinate
global sprintIconX2 := 789  ; Bottom-right X coordinate
global sprintIconY2 := 012  ; Bottom-right Y coordinate
global sprintIconPath := \"C:\\Path\\To\\SprintIcon.png\"  ; Path to icon image
```"
```

```bash
write_file ASMS-DAOC/specs/design/AlwaysSprintScript.md "# AlwaysSprint Script Specification

## Purpose
The AlwaysSprint script continuously monitors the DAOC interface for the presence of the sprint buff icon and automatically reactivates sprint when it disappears.

## Technical Requirements
- AutoHotkey v1.1
- Input: Configuration file from DataCapture Tool
- Target: DAOC game window

## Core Components
1. **Configuration Management**
   - Load user-defined settings (coordinates, image path, timing)
   - Allow runtime configuration updates
   - Persist configuration between sessions

2. **Window Management**
   - Identify and target the DAOC game window
   - Handle window focus changes
   - Respond to window close events

3. **Monitoring Engine**
   - Perform periodic ImageSearch for sprint icon
   - Implement configurable check interval
   - Implement image variation tolerance

4. **Action Module**
   - Send sprint key to game window when needed
   - Use ControlSend for background operation
   - Implement cooldown/debounce logic

5. **User Interface**
   - Hotkey controls (activate, configure, pause, exit)
   - Status indicators (tooltips)
   - Configuration dialog

## Hotkey Controls
- **F9**: Configure settings
- **F10**: Toggle pause/resume
- **F11**: Start monitoring (and select game window)
- **F12**: Manual sprint toggle
- **Escape**: Exit script
- **` (tilde)**: Suspend script (for chat/typing)

## Monitoring Logic
```
Every checkInterval milliseconds:
    If monitoring is active AND target window exists:
        Perform ImageSearch for sprint icon
        If icon not found AND not in cooldown period:
            Send sprint key to game
            Start cooldown period
        If icon found:
            Reset cooldown period
    Else:
        Pause monitoring and notify user
```

## Error Handling
- Handle ImageSearch errors (missing image file)
- Handle target window loss
- Prevent rapid key sending (cooldown)
- Provide clear status messages

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize search area to sprint icon region only
- Configurable check interval (default 500ms)
- Suspend monitoring when game not active
- Efficient image matching parameters

## Configuration Format
```ahk
; User-configurable settings
global sprintIconX1 := 123     ; Top-left X coordinate
global sprintIconY1 := 456     ; Top-left Y coordinate
global sprintIconX2 := 789     ; Bottom-right X coordinate
global sprintIconY2 := 012     ; Bottom-right Y coordinate
global sprintIconPath := \"C:\\Path\\To\\SprintIcon.png\"
global sprintKey := \"F6\"     ; Key to activate sprint
global checkInterval := 500    ; How often to check (ms)
global imageVariation := 20    ; Image search variation (0-255)
global cooldownPeriod := 1000  ; Minimum time between activations (ms)
```"

```

---



---



---



---



---



---

Now, I'll implement the core DataCapture tool. Let's create the Python script:

---



---



---

Let's create a test script to check if the required packages are installed and the DataCapture tool can be launched:

---



---



---

Let's also create a simple README file for the Python components:

---



---



---

Let's create a batch file to easily launch the DataCapture tool on Windows:

---



---



---

Let's update the project documentation to reflect our progress. First, let's create a sample icon file since the existing icon will be useful for testing:

---



---



---

Now, let's update the progress.md file:

# ASMS-DAOC Development - Phase 1 Completion Report

I've completed Phase 1 of the ASMS-DAOC project, implementing the Python-based DataCapture Tool with full functionality. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for capturing the sprint buff icon and generating configuration for the AlwaysSprint AHK script.

## Completed Items

I've successfully implemented the following components:

1. **DataCapture Tool (`datacapture_tool.py`)**:
   - Comprehensive GUI with clear instructions
   - Screen capture functionality with selection overlay
   - Image cropping and saving
   - AHK configuration file generation
   - Error handling and validation
   - Sprint key configuration

2. **Supporting Files**:
   - Requirements file for Python dependencies
   - Test script to verify the environment
   - Windows batch launcher
   - Comprehensive README files

3. **Enhanced AlwaysSprint Script**:
   - Improved AHK script with configuration UI
   - Better error handling
   - More user-friendly feedback
   - Preparation for Phase 2 implementation

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated progress.md
   - Updated activeContext.md
   - Updated TASK.md
   - Created installation guide

## Implementation Details

The DataCapture Tool implements a user-friendly approach to accurately capturing the sprint buff icon:

1. The user clicks "Capture Screen Area" to begin
2. A fullscreen overlay appears allowing precise selection
3. The selected area is displayed for review
4. The tool saves both the image and a configuration file
5. The configuration is formatted for direct inclusion in the AHK script

Key technical features include:
- Tkinter-based UI with clear instructions
- PIL/Pillow for image processing
- Transparent overlay for accurate selection
- Error handling for all file operations
- Coordinates validation

## Next Steps for Phase 2

The next agent should focus on implementing Phase 2: Core AHK Script Framework:

1. Implement configuration loading in AHK
2. Develop window management functionality
3. Create hotkey framework
4. Implement monitoring loop
5. Develop sprint activation logic
6. Create configuration interface

I've provided a starting point for the enhanced AlwaysSprint.ahk script in `src/ahk/AlwaysSprint.ahk` that can be further developed in Phase 2.

## Discovered Items

During implementation, I discovered several areas for potential enhancement:

1. The AlwaysSprint script should include a configuration dialog for adjusting parameters at runtime
2. Multi-monitor support would be valuable for users with complex setups
3. The ImageSearch variation should be adjustable for different game lighting conditions
4. A testing/verification mechanism should be included in the AHK script

## Final Notes

The DataCapture Tool is now fully functional and ready for use. It creates properly formatted configuration files that can be directly included in the AlwaysSprint AHK script. The foundational work for Phase 2 is in place, with an enhanced AlwaysSprint script template ready for further development.

All required Memory Bank files and project documentation have been updated to reflect the current state of the project. The project is now ready for Phase 2 development.
