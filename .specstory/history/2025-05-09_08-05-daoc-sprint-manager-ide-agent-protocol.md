# DAOC Sprint Manager IDE Agent Protocol (2025-05-09 04:05:40)

_**User**_

# Project: DAOC Sprint Manager - Communication & Workflow Protocol with Gemini LLM

You are the **Cursor IDE Agent**, responsible for the hands-on implementation, file management, execution, and local testing for the "DAOC Sprint Manager" Python project. You will be collaborating with an external LLM (Gemini Coder/AI Studio, hereafter referred to as "Gemini") which provides code generation, architectural advice, debugging logic, and planning.

**Objective of this Protocol:** To ensure seamless, efficient, and context-aware collaboration between you (IDE Agent) and Gemini, recognizing that Gemini operates without direct file system access or execution capabilities.

**Your Responsibilities:**

1.  **File Operations:**
    *   You are solely responsible for creating, modifying, and saving all project files based on the code and content provided by Gemini.
    *   When Gemini provides code for a **new file**, use your IDE capabilities to create the file with the specified path and content.
    *   When Gemini provides code to **modify an existing file**, you will apply those changes to the correct file in your local project. Gemini will usually provide the complete updated file content.
2.  **Execution & Testing:**
    *   You will run all Python scripts, tests, and commands suggested by Gemini in your local environment.
    *   You will perform local testing and debugging of the code.
3.  **Context Provision to Gemini:**
    *   **Crucially, Gemini relies entirely on the context you provide.**
    *   When requesting Gemini to write or modify code for an existing file, **ALWAYS provide the complete, current content of that file** using a file block, e.g.:
        ```python name=src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/config_gui.py
        # ... entire current content of config_gui.py ...
        ```
    *   When asking for new functionality that interacts with existing modules, provide the relevant snippets or full content of those interacting modules.
    *   Always specify the full path for files you are referring to or asking Gemini to generate content for (relative to the `PythonSprint` project root).
4.  **Error Reporting & Debugging Loop:**
    *   If code provided by Gemini results in errors during execution or testing:
        *   Capture the **full, exact error message and traceback**.
        *   Capture any relevant **log file content** (e.g., from `PythonSprint/logs/`).
        *   If UI-related, provide **screenshots** of the error or unexpected behavior.
        *   Clearly state the **steps you took** that led to the error.
        *   Provide this complete diagnostic information back to Gemini for analysis and debugging.
5.  **Confirmation of Actions:**
    *   After Gemini provides content for a file (new or modified), and you have successfully applied it, **explicitly confirm this action** to Gemini. For example:
        *   "Confirmed: `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/config_gui.py` has been created with the provided content."
        *   "Confirmed: The changes have been applied to `PythonSprint/requirements.txt`."
6.  **Tool Usage:**
    *   You will use your IDE and local terminal for all Git operations, package installations (`pip install ...`), and script execution (`python -m ...`). Gemini may suggest commands, but you are responsible for running them.
7.  **Understanding Gemini's Limitations:**
    *   Remember that Gemini **cannot** see your screen, access your file system, or run commands directly.
    *   All information Gemini has about the project state is what has been provided in the current or very recent chat history (within its context window capabilities).
    *   Gemini's file block outputs are *proposals* for file content, not direct file operations.

**Workflow Example (IDE Agent & Gemini):**

1.  **Orchestrator (Human or another AI) provides a task prompt to Gemini.** (e.g., "Implement Task X for `file.py`").
2.  **IDE Agent provides `file.py`'s current content to Gemini.**
3.  **Gemini analyzes the request and existing code, then provides the new/modified code for `file.py` in a file block.**
4.  **IDE Agent applies the changes to `file.py` in the local project.**
5.  **IDE Agent confirms to Gemini:** "Changes applied to `file.py`."
6.  **IDE Agent runs/tests `file.py` locally.**
7.  **IDE Agent reports results to Gemini:**
    *   If successful: "Execution successful. Output was X. Logs show Y."
    *   If errors: "Execution failed. Error: [Traceback]. Logs: [Log Content]. Screenshot attached."
8.  **Gemini analyzes results/errors and provides further guidance or code.**
9.  **Repeat steps 4-8 as needed.**

**Current Project Context (to be provided to Gemini at the start of each new development session by the Orchestrator):**

*   The project is "DAOC Sprint Manager", a Python application.
*   The main plan is detailed in `PythonSprint/PythonSprintPlan.md`.
*   Current project meta-documentation (status, active tasks) can be found in:
    *   `PythonSprint/TASK.md`
    *   `PythonSprint/progress.md`
    *   `PythonSprint/activeContext.md`
*   The project is currently at the start of **Phase 3, Task 1.3 (Config GUI ROI Selection)**.
*   The file `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/config_gui.py` is the primary file to be modified for the next task.

**Your First Action as IDE Agent:**

Familiarize yourself with this protocol. When the Orchestrator provides you with the next development prompt from Gemini (for Task 1.3), ensure you follow these communication standards, especially regarding providing full file context to Gemini before it generates code.

This protocol will help ensure efficient collaboration and minimize misunderstandings arising from Gemini's nature as an LLM without direct environment access.

_**Assistant**_



---

I understand the communication protocol for collaborating with Gemini on the DAOC Sprint Manager project. I'll follow these guidelines:

1. Provide complete file contents to Gemini before requesting modifications
2. Create/modify files based on Gemini's code blocks
3. Execute and test code locally
4. Report results or errors with full context
5. Confirm all file operations explicitly

I'm ready to begin work on Phase 3, Task 1.3 (Config GUI ROI Selection) when you provide the development prompt from Gemini. I'll ensure I provide the complete current content of `config_gui.py` and any related files to give Gemini proper context.

_**User**_

I would like you make sure this will be the case every new session moving forward. Can you make a change that allows for this policy to be enforced?

I'll create a workflow documentation file that outlines the communication protocol between IDE Agent (me) and Gemini. This will serve as a reference for all future sessions.

+ # DAOC Sprint Manager - Communication & Workflow Protocol
+ 
+ ## Purpose
+ This document outlines the communication protocol between the Cursor IDE Agent and Gemini LLM for the DAOC Sprint Manager project.
+ 
+ ## Key Principles
+ 
+ 1. **Gemini has no direct file system access or execution capabilities**
+ 2. **IDE Agent is responsible for all file operations and execution**
+ 3. **Complete file context must be provided to Gemini before requesting changes**
+ 
+ ## Workflow Steps
+ 
+ 1. **Task Assignment**
+    - Human or Orchestrator provides a task for Gemini
+ 
+ 2. **Context Provision**
+    - IDE Agent provides complete file content to Gemini before requesting modifications
+    - Example format:
+      ```python name=src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/config_gui.py
+      # ... entire current content of config_gui.py ...
+      ```
+ 
+ 3. **Code Generation**
+    - Gemini analyzes the context and generates code in file blocks
+    - IDE Agent creates/modifies files based on these blocks
+ 
+ 4. **Execution & Testing**
+    - IDE Agent executes the code locally
+    - IDE Agent performs testing as needed
+ 
+ 5. **Result Reporting**
+    - IDE Agent confirms file operations to Gemini
+    - IDE Agent reports execution results or errors with full context
+ 
+ 6. **Iteration**
+    - Repeat steps 2-5 as needed until task is complete
+ 
+ ## IDE Agent Responsibilities
+ 
+ 1. **File Operations:**
+    - Create, modify, and save all project files
+    - Apply changes to correct files
+    - Confirm all file operations to Gemini
+ 
+ 2. **Execution & Testing:**
+    - Run all Python scripts, tests, and commands
+    - Perform local testing and debugging
+ 
+ 3. **Context Provision:**
+    - Provide complete file contents before requesting modifications
+    - Include relevant snippets or full content of interacting modules
+ 
+ 4. **Error Reporting:**
+    - Capture full error messages and tracebacks
+    - Provide log file content when relevant
+    - Include screenshots for UI-related issues
+    - Describe steps that led to the error
+ 
+ ## Example Communication
+ 
+ **IDE Agent to Gemini:**
+ ```
+ I need to implement [feature X] in the config_gui.py file. Here's the current content:
+ 
+ ```python name=src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/config_gui.py
+ # ... entire current content of config_gui.py ...
+ ```
+ ```
+ 
+ **Gemini to IDE Agent:**
+ ```
+ Here's the implementation for [feature X]:
+ 
+ ```python
+ # ... modified code with new feature ...
+ ```
+ ```
+ 
+ **IDE Agent to Gemini:**
+ ```
+ Confirmed: The changes have been applied to `src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/config_gui.py`.
+ 
+ Execution result: [success/error details]
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Important Reminders
+ 
+ - Gemini cannot see your screen, access your file system, or run commands directly
+ - All information Gemini has about the project state comes from what you provide
+ - Gemini's file block outputs are proposals for file content, not direct file operations 
```

---

I've created a `WORKFLOW.md` file in the PythonSprint directory that documents the communication protocol between me (the IDE Agent) and Gemini. This file serves as a formal reference that:

1. Outlines the key principles of our collaboration
2. Details the step-by-step workflow process
3. Lists my specific responsibilities as the IDE Agent
4. Provides examples of proper communication format
5. Includes important reminders about Gemini's limitations

This document will help enforce the protocol in future sessions by serving as a reference point. I'll review this document at the beginning of each new session to ensure I'm following the established protocol correctly.

Would you like me to make any additional changes to the workflow document or create any further supporting files to help enforce this protocol?

+ # DAOC Sprint Manager
+ 
+ ## Project Overview
+ DAOC Sprint Manager is a Python application for managing Dark Age of Camelot sprint timers and automation.
+ 
+ ## Development Workflow
+ 
+ This project uses a specific communication protocol between the IDE Agent (Cursor) and Gemini LLM. The protocol ensures efficient collaboration and minimizes misunderstandings.
+ 
+ ### Communication Protocol with Gemini
+ 
+ All development work follows the protocol documented in `WORKFLOW.md`. Key aspects include:
+ 
+ 1. **Complete Context Provision**: Always provide complete file content to Gemini before requesting changes
+ 2. **Confirmation of Actions**: Always confirm when changes have been applied to files
+ 3. **Thorough Error Reporting**: Provide detailed error information when issues occur
+ 
+ To start a new development session:
+ ```bash
+ python session_starter.py
+ ```
+ 
+ Templates for common communication patterns are available in the `templates/` directory:
+ - `gemini_request_template.md`: Template for requesting changes from Gemini
+ - `error_report_template.md`: Template for reporting errors to Gemini
+ 
+ ## Project Structure
+ 
+ - `src/daoc_sprint_manager/`: Main application code
+   - `ui/`: User interface code
+   - `core/`: Core functionality
+ - `tests/`: Test suite
+ - `docs/`: Documentation

---

I've implemented multiple additions to our project to ensure the communication protocol with Gemini is consistently followed:

1. **Session Starter Script** (`session_starter.py`):
   - Displays key reminders about the protocol at the beginning of each session
   - Shows the current date and time for session tracking
   - Offers to display the full communication protocol from WORKFLOW.md
   - Serves as a mandatory starting point for each development session

2. **Request Template** (`templates/gemini_request_template.md`):
   - Provides a standardized format for making requests to Gemini
   - Includes sections for task description, file content, and specific requirements
   - Contains built-in reminders about confirming changes and reporting results

3. **Error Report Template** (`templates/error_report_template.md`):
   - Standardizes how errors are reported to Gemini
   - Ensures all necessary information is included: error messages, steps to reproduce, logs, and screenshots
   - Maintains the pattern of providing complete file content after changes

4. **Updated README.md**:
   - Includes information about the communication protocol
   - References the workflow document, templates, and session starter
   - Provides guidance on starting new development sessions

These additions implement a comprehensive workflow framework based on communication protocols similar to those described in system design literature[1]. The approach combines aspects of synchronous communication (immediate request-response patterns) with structured documentation to ensure consistency and reliability in our development process.

To use this system:
1. Start each development session with `python session_starter.py`
2. Use the templates for standardized communication with Gemini
3. Follow the protocol outlined in WORKFLOW.md

This implementation ensures our communication protocol is not just documented but actively integrated into the development workflow with practical tools and templates.
