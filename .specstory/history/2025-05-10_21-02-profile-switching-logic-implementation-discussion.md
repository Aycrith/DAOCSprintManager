# Profile Switching Logic Implementation Discussion (2025-05-10 17:02:20)

_**User**_

Okay, I've reviewed the project status and the next logical step is **Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic**.

The previous tasks (especially 3.2 Part 2) have laid most of the groundwork for profile switching by implementing `TrayApp._apply_active_profile_settings()` and the mechanism for `ProfileManagerDialog` to notify `TrayApp` of active profile changes.

This task will focus on ensuring the `last_used_date` of a profile is updated and persisted correctly when it's activated, and verifying that the application correctly reconfigures itself based on the newly active profile's settings.

First, I will update the meta-documentation to reflect the completion of the previous task and the start of this new one.

**Updating Meta-Documentation...**

1.  **`PythonSprint/TASK.md`**:
    *   Marked "Phase 3, Task 3.2 (Part 2: Profile Manager CRUD & Persistence)" as complete.
    *   Set "Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic" as the current task.

2.  **`PythonSprint/progress.md`**:
    *   Added "Phase 3, Task 3.2 (Part 2: Profile Manager CRUD & Persistence)" to "Completed Phases & Steps" with a summary of its achievements.
    *   Updated "Current Development Focus" to "Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic".

3.  **`PythonSprint/activeContext.md`**:
    *   Updated "Current Focus" to "Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic".
    *   Summarized the completion of Task 3.2 Part 2.
    *   Outlined the detailed requirements for Task 3.3.

Meta-documentation updates are complete.

Here is the detailed prompt for the Coder AI to implement **Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic**:

# PyDAOC Sprint Manager - Coder Task: Phase 3, Task 3.3 - Profile Switching Logic

## Project Overview & Current Status
You are the **Coder AI** for the "PyDAOC Sprint Manager" project.
-   **Phase 1 & 2**: COMPLETE.
-   **Phase 3, Task 3.1 (Profile Data Structure)**: COMPLETE.
-   **Phase 3, Task 3.2 (Profile Manager UI & CRUD/Persistence)**: COMPLETE. The `ProfileManagerDialog` is functional for CRUD operations, profiles are persisted to `profiles.json`, and the `TrayApp` has basic mechanisms for applying an active profile's settings.
-   **Current State**: The application can manage profiles, but the act of switching a profile (making it active) needs to ensure `last_used_date` is updated and persisted, and that all application components correctly reconfigure based on the new profile's settings.

## Your Current Task: Phase 3, Task 3.3 - Implement Profile Switching Logic Refinements

Your task is to refine the profile switching logic to ensure that when a profile is activated, its `last_used_date` is updated and saved, and to verify that the application's `_load_resources` method correctly re-initializes all components based on the new active profile's `AppSettings`.

**(IDE Agent Note: Before Gemini generates code, please provide the complete current content of the following files using file blocks, as per `WORKFLOW.md`):**
*   `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py`
*   `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/profile_manager_dialog.py`
*   `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/core/profile_io_manager.py` (for reference)
*   `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/data_models.py` (for `Profile` and `AppSettings` reference)
*   `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/config_manager.py` (for reference)

## Detailed Requirements:

### 1. Update `Profile.last_used_date` on Activation and Persist

*   **In `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py` (`SprintManagerApp` class):**
    *   Modify the `_select_profile(self, profile: Profile)` method:
        1.  After successfully saving the `active_profile_id` to the global `settings.json` using `self.config_manager.save_settings(global_settings)`.
        2.  Load all profiles using `self.profile_io_manager.load_profiles()`.
        3.  Iterate through `all_profiles` to find the profile object whose `profile_id` matches the just-selected `profile.profile_id`.
        4.  If found, update its `last_used_date` attribute to `datetime.utcnow()`.
        5.  Save the modified `all_profiles` list back to disk using `self.profile_io_manager.save_profiles(all_profiles)`. Log success or failure.
        6.  The existing call to `self._apply_active_profile_settings()` should remain to apply the settings.
        7.  Ensure proper error handling for file operations.

*   **In `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/profile_manager_dialog.py` (`ProfileManagerDialog` class):**
    *   Modify the `_set_active_profile(self)` method:
        1.  After successfully saving the `active_profile_id` to the global settings using `self.main_config_manager.save_settings(current_global_settings)`.
        2.  Iterate through `self.profiles` (the dialog's internal list of profiles) to find the profile object whose `profile_id` matches the `selected_profile_id`.
        3.  If found, update its `last_used_date` attribute to `datetime.utcnow()`.
        4.  Save the updated `self.profiles` list to disk using `self.profile_io_manager.save_profiles(self.profiles)`. Log success or failure.
        5.  The existing call to `self._load_profiles_to_list()` will refresh the UI, and the `on_active_profile_changed_callback` will notify `TrayApp`.

### 2. Verify `_load_resources` Robustness in `SprintManagerApp`

*   **In `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py` (`SprintManagerApp` class):**
    *   Review the `_load_resources(self, is_reload: bool = False)` method.
    *   Ensure that it correctly and completely re-initializes or updates all components that depend on `self.app_settings` when `is_reload` is `True`. This includes:
        *   `IconDetector`: Re-instantiate or update with `self.app_settings.temporal_consistency_frames`. Reload `self.sprint_on_template` using `self.app_settings.sprint_on_icon_path`.
        *   `MLDetector`: Re-instantiate `self.ml_detector` if `self.app_settings.detection_method == "ml"`, using new `ml_model_path`, `ml_input_size_wh`, and `ml_confidence_threshold` from `self.app_settings`. If the method changes from "ml" to "template", ensure `self.ml_detector` is set to `None`.
        *   Verify that error handling within `_load_resources` (e.g., for missing model files or templates during a reload) is graceful and doesn't crash the application (as addressed in Task 3.3). The focus here is ensuring all relevant settings are reapplied.
    *   **No new code is expected here unless a component's re-initialization based on `AppSettings` was missed in prior tasks.** This is primarily a review and confirmation step integrated into the profile switching task.

### 3. Testing Considerations (For User/QA after implementation)
*   Test activating a profile from the tray menu. Verify:
    *   The application's behavior changes according to the selected profile's settings (e.g., `sprint_key`, ROI changes if you have a visual indicator, detection method if logged).
    *   The `last_used_date` for the activated profile in `profiles.json` is updated.
    *   The "Active" column/indicator in `ProfileManagerDialog` updates correctly if it's open.
    *   The tray menu checkmark updates to the newly active profile.
*   Test setting a profile as active from the `ProfileManagerDialog`. Verify:
    *   Similar behavior changes and `last_used_date` updates.
    *   The tray menu checkmark updates.
*   Test application startup: Ensure the profile marked as active in `settings.json` (via `active_profile_id`) is indeed the one whose settings are applied on startup.
*   Test switching between profiles with different `detection_method` settings ("template" vs. "ml") to ensure detectors are re-initialized correctly.

## Guidelines & Context:
*   **Primary Reference**: `PythonSprint/PythonSprintPlan.md`, especially sections related to profile activation and application state.
*   **Quality Standards**: Adhere to Universal Code Quality and Architectural Standards (PEP 8, type hints, Google Style Docstrings, error handling).
*   **Focus**: This task ensures data integrity (`last_used_date`) and verifies the dynamic reconfiguration capabilities of the application when switching profiles.
*   **Relevant Files**: `tray_app.py`, `profile_manager_dialog.py`.

## Deliverables for This Step:

1.  Updated content for `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py`.
2.  Updated content for `PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/profile_manager_dialog.py`.

## Handoff Instruction for Coder AI:

**After completing all deliverables for this specific task (Phase 3, Task 3.3), explicitly state "Phase 3, Task 3.3 (Profile Switching Logic) deliverables complete." and await further instructions for the Orchestrator AI.**

Now that I have reviewed the code, I can implement the required changes for Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic. Let me update each file as specified in the requirements.

First, let's update the tray_app.py file to update the Profile.last_used_date when a profile is activated:

---

```diff
          if save_ok:
              self.logger.info(f"Set active profile ID to '{profile.profile_id}' in global settings.")
+             
+             # Update the last_used_date for the profile and save it
+             all_profiles = self.profile_io_manager.load_profiles()
+             selected_profile = next((p for p in all_profiles if p.profile_id == profile.profile_id), None)
+             if selected_profile:
+                 # Update the last_used_date
+                 from datetime import datetime
+                 selected_profile.last_used_date = datetime.utcnow()
+                 # Save all profiles with the updated last_used_date
+                 if self.profile_io_manager.save_profiles(all_profiles):
+                     self.logger.info(f"Updated last_used_date for profile '{profile.profile_name}'")
+                 else:
+                     self.logger.error(f"Failed to save updated last_used_date for profile '{profile.profile_name}'")
+             
              self._apply_active_profile_settings() # This updates self.app_settings and reloads resources
              
```

---

Now, let's update the profile_manager_dialog.py file to update the last_used_date when a profile is set as active from the dialog:

---

```diff
          if self.main_config_manager.save_settings(current_global_settings):
              self.logger.info(f"Profile ID '{selected_profile_id}' set as active in global settings.")
+             
+             # Update the last_used_date for the selected profile
+             selected_profile = next((p for p in self.profiles if p.profile_id == selected_profile_id), None)
+             if selected_profile:
+                 # Update the last_used_date
+                 from datetime import datetime
+                 selected_profile.last_used_date = datetime.utcnow()
+                 # Save all profiles with the updated last_used_date
+                 if self.profile_io_manager.save_profiles(self.profiles):
+                     self.logger.info(f"Updated last_used_date for profile '{selected_profile.profile_name}'")
+                 else:
+                     self.logger.error(f"Failed to save updated last_used_date for profile '{selected_profile.profile_name}'")
+             
              self._load_profiles_to_list() # Refresh list to show new active profile
              if self.on_active_profile_changed_callback:
```

---

Now, let's review the _load_resources method in tray_app.py to verify its robustness for handling different profiles with potentially different detection methods:

---

Read file: PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py

---

Let's look for the _load_resources method in the rest of the file:

---

</details>

Read file: src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py

---

After reviewing the files and code, I can see that the _load_resources method in tray_app.py is already quite robust in handling different detector configurations based on the selected profile. It properly:

1. Handles template loading based on the active profile's settings
2. Initializes or clears the ML detector based on the detection_method setting
3. Provides appropriate fallbacks if resources are missing
4. Handles errors gracefully during both initial loading and reloading

Both _select_profile in SprintManagerApp and _set_active_profile in ProfileManagerDialog now correctly update the last_used_date of the activated profile and save it to disk.

Let's verify if there is a clear call to _load_resources in the _apply_active_profile_settings method since that's what gets called when switching profiles:

Now let's check if _apply_active_profile_settings calls _load_resources with is_reload=True when processing profiles:

---

Read file: PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py

---

Let's look at the _handle_active_profile_change_from_dialog method since it might need to be modified to properly load resources:

---

Read file: PythonSprint/src/daoc_sprint_manager/ui/tray_app.py

---

I need to check if _apply_active_profile_settings is properly calling _load_resources with is_reload=True when it's used to reload a profile. Let me read that method more carefully:

Let me check if the _apply_active_profile_settings method calls _load_resources with is_reload=True. I need to add this call if it's missing:

---

```diff
  
          self.logger.info(f"Initial AppSettings loaded from: {initial_app_settings_source}")
-         # Resources (like detectors) should be reloaded/re-initialized based on the now active self.app_settings
-         # This is usually done by calling _load_resources(is_reload=True)
-         # We will call _load_resources in __init__ after this method.
- 
+         
+         # Always reload resources when applying profile settings
+         self._load_resources(is_reload=True)
+         
+         # Resources (like detectors) have been reloaded/re-initialized based on the now active self.app_settings
  
      def _update_status(self, message: str):
```

---

Now I need to adjust the __init__ method to not call _load_resources separately since it's now called by _apply_active_profile_settings:

---

```diff
          self.current_profile: Optional[Profile] = None
          self._apply_active_profile_settings() # Load and apply active profile settings at startup
- 
-         # _load_resources should be called after _apply_active_profile_settings
-         # as app_settings might change based on the active profile.
-         self._load_resources() 
+         # _load_resources is now called by _apply_active_profile_settings
          
          self.logger.info("SprintManagerApp initialized.")
```

---

Let's also make sure the tray's menu is updated properly when profiles change:

---

```diff
              self.pystray_icon.update_menu()
          
+         # Update status to reflect the newly active profile
          if self.current_profile:
              self._update_status(f"Profile: {self.current_profile.profile_name} ({self.app_settings.detection_method})")
```

---

Now that we've made all the necessary changes, let's verify the remaining tasks in the requirements:

1. ✅ Updated the `_select_profile` method in `tray_app.py` to update the profile's `last_used_date` and save it.
2. ✅ Updated the `_set_active_profile` method in `profile_manager_dialog.py` to update the profile's `last_used_date` and save it.
3. ✅ Updated the `_apply_active_profile_settings` method in `tray_app.py` to call `_load_resources(is_reload=True)` to ensure profile changes are properly applied.
4. ✅ Updated the `__init__` method in `tray_app.py` to remove redundant `_load_resources` call.
5. ✅ Verified that the status and UI are updated properly when profiles change.

All the requirements for Phase 3, Task 3.3 (Profile Switching Logic) have been implemented.

Phase 3, Task 3.3 (Profile Switching Logic) deliverables complete.

# DAOC Sprint Manager - Active Context

## Current Focus: Profile Auto-Switching (Phase 3, Task 3.4)

## Current Task Status
- ✅ Phase 3, Task 3.1: Profile Data Structure - COMPLETED
- ✅ Phase 3, Task 3.2, Part 1: Profile Manager UI Framework & Tray Integration - COMPLETED
- ✅ Phase 3, Task 3.2, Part 2: Profile Manager CRUD Operations & Persistence - COMPLETED
- ✅ Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic - COMPLETED
- 🔄 Phase 3, Task 3.4: Auto-Switching Feature - IN PROGRESS

## Task Description
Following the successful implementation of Profile CRUD operations, persistence, and manual switching logic (Tasks 3.2 Part 2 & 3.3), we are now focusing on implementing the **Auto-Switching Feature** (Task 3.4).

This involves:
1.  Adding a mechanism to associate window title patterns (e.g., specific character names in the game window title) with profiles.
2.  Implementing logic within the application (likely in `SprintManagerApp` or `TrayApp`) to monitor the active game window title.
3.  Automatically switching to the appropriate profile when a matching window title is detected.
4.  Providing a UI element (e.g., in the `ProfileEditDialog`) to configure these window title patterns per profile.
5.  Ensuring robust logging for auto-switch events.

## Previously Completed Tasks
- ✅ **Completed Phase 1** (Foundation & Basic Detection)
- ✅ **Completed Phase 2** (Advanced Detection & Input System)
- ✅ **Phase 3, Task 1: Configuration GUI Implementation** (All sub-tasks completed)
- ✅ **Phase 3, Task 2: ML-Based Detection** (All sub-tasks completed)
- ✅ **Phase 3, Task 3.1: Profile Data Structure**
- ✅ **Phase 3, Task 3.2, Part 1: Profile Manager UI Framework & Tray Integration**
- ✅ **Phase 3, Task 3.2, Part 2: Profile Manager CRUD Operations & Persistence**
  - ✅ Implemented `ProfileEditDialog` for creating and editing profiles.
  - ✅ Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in `ProfileManagerDialog`.
  - ✅ Implemented profile persistence using `ProfileIOManager` (saving/loading from `profiles/profiles.json`).
  - ✅ Added import/export capabilities for profiles.
  - ✅ Implemented logic for setting the active profile, stored in global `settings.json`.
- ✅ **Phase 3, Task 3.3: Profile Switching Logic**
  - ✅ Implemented loading of the active profile's settings upon application start or when changed.
  - ✅ Ensured detection resources (templates, ML models) are re-initialized upon profile switch.
  - ✅ Dynamic updates of application behavior based on the active profile's settings.
  - ✅ Persistence of the active profile choice.

## Architectural Decisions

- Detection method fallbacks are handled in memory only (for the current session).
- Status messages include the active detection method for better user feedback.
- The ML detector initialization has comprehensive error handling with specific error messages.
- ML model paths and input sizes are configured through the Configuration GUI.
- The application gracefully handles failures with auto-pause and auto-resume capabilities.
- Resource loading failures during settings changes are non-fatal and properly communicated to users.
- The Dataset Collection Utility is implemented as a standalone tool.
- Profiles use Pydantic models for validation and serialization.
- Profiles are stored in a dedicated `profiles/profiles.json` file.
- The active profile is determined by an `active_profile_id` in the main `config/settings.json`.
- Profile switching involves reloading `AppSettings` from the selected profile and re-initializing relevant components.

### Profile Management Decisions

- Profile data structure uses a dedicated Pydantic model (`Profile`) embedding an `AppSettings` instance.
- Unique profile identifiers (UUID4) are used.
- Profile versioning is built-in.
- Datetime fields use UTC timestamps.
- CRUD operations are managed through `ProfileManagerDialog` and persisted by `ProfileIOManager`.
- Active profile selection updates `active_profile_id` in the global `settings.json`.

## Key Considerations for Auto-Switching (Task 3.4)

1.  **Pattern Matching**:
    *   Define how window title patterns are stored (e.g., regex, simple substring).
    *   Consider case sensitivity options.
    *   How to handle multiple patterns or overlapping patterns? (e.g., priority).
2.  **Monitoring Frequency**:
    *   How often should the application check the active window title?
    *   Balance responsiveness with performance impact.
3.  **User Configuration**:
    *   Where will users define these patterns? (Likely `ProfileEditDialog`).
    *   Needs to be intuitive for users.
4.  **Notifications/Feedback**:
    *   Should the user be notified when an auto-switch occurs?
    *   How to handle cases where no matching profile is found for the current window?
5.  **Enabling/Disabling**:
    *   Should auto-switching be a global toggleable feature?

## Implementation Notes for Auto-Switching (Task 3.4)

1.  **Data Model Update**: Extend `Profile` model in `data_models.py` to include a field for `window_title_pattern` (e.g., `Optional[str]` or `List[str]`).
2.  **UI Update**: Add an entry field in `ProfileEditDialog` for `window_title_pattern`.
3.  **Core Logic**:
    *   In `SprintManagerApp.run_detection_logic` (or a dedicated thread), periodically get the active window title.
    *   Compare this title against the `window_title_pattern` of all available profiles.
    *   If a match is found and it's not the current active profile, trigger a profile switch (similar to `_select_profile`).
4.  **Settings**: Add a global setting (e.g., `enable_auto_profile_switching: bool`) in `AppSettings`.

## Resources and References

1.  **Existing Code References**:
    *   `data_models.py` (for `Profile` model)
    *   `ui/profile_edit_dialog.py` (for UI changes)
    *   `ui/tray_app.py` (for `SprintManagerApp` logic, `_select_profile`)
    *   `core/window_manager.py` (for getting window titles)
    *   `core/profile_io_manager.py` (for loading all profiles to check patterns)

## Development Approach for Auto-Switching (Task 3.4)

1.  Start by updating the `Profile` data model and `ProfileEditDialog`.
2.  Implement the window title monitoring and pattern matching logic.
3.  Integrate the auto-switching call.
4.  Add configuration options (e.g., enable/disable).
5.  Test thoroughly with different window titles and patterns.

## Testing Considerations for Auto-Switching (Task 3.4)

1.  Test with exact title matches.
2.  Test with partial/substring matches (if supported).
3.  Test with regex patterns (if supported).
4.  Verify behavior when multiple game windows are open (if applicable).
5.  Ensure switching is smooth and doesn't cause performance issues.
6.  Test what happens if no profile matches the current window title.
7.  Test enabling/disabling the feature.

## Current Blockers

None identified.

## Next Steps After Current Focus

After completing Profile Auto-Switching:
1.  Task 3.5: Testing and Refinement for all Profile Management features.
2.  Begin work on Quality of Life Improvements (Task 4.1 onwards).
